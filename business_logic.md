# 1. The Big Idea: Your Brand, Your Platform

Right now, your amazing community lives on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. This is fantastic for reaching people. However, when it's time to sell tickets for a show, you're relying on manual processes and sending fans to different places.

We want to build a **central, professional online home** for the **"Mkenya Isaak 7Million"** brand. Think of it as **your own digital stage**. It’s the **one link** you’ll put in all your social media bios, making it incredibly easy for your fans to find everything they need.

This platform will not just be a website; it will be **your personal business engine**, designed to grow with you from your first show to sold-out arenas.

# 2. What Your Fans Will Experience (The User Story)

Imagine one of your fans — let’s call her **Aisha**.

1. She sees your new TikTok announcing a live show in Nairobi. In the video, you say: **“Get your tickets now! Link in bio!”**
2. Aisha clicks the link in your bio and lands on **your beautiful, official website**. The site feels just like your brand—fun, energetic, professional.
3. On the homepage, she sees a **scrolling feed of your latest video clips**, confirming she’s in the right place.
4. She clicks the **“Nairobi Live Show”** event and sees the poster, date, time, and venue.
5. She selects two **Regular** tickets for herself and a friend. She enters her details.
6. The site shows her the **M-Pesa Paybill number** and the exact amount to pay.
7. After she pays, **instantly**, an official email from *“Mkenya Isaak 7Million”* lands in her inbox with her ticket, featuring a **unique QR code** and an **8-digit code**.
8. On show day, she walks to the gate, opens the email, and staff scan her QR code.  
   **Beep — green. She’s in.**  
   No long lines. No confusion.

This is the smooth, professional experience we will build for every single fan.
